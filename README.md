# Matt’s Magic Beans Adventure

A comprehensive documentation project focused on achieving optimal audio reproduction through parametric equalization (PEQ) using the Wiim Ultra streamer and precision speaker/subwoofer tuning using the Magic Beans True Target app and EQ methodology.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository documents my journey toward audio end game using scientific measurement and targeted EQ adjustments using Magic Beans True Target for EQ. The project centers on optimizing a high-end audio system through precise parametric equalization, sharing findings, and building a collaborative knowledge base for the audiophile community.

## 🔧 Equipment Setup

### Primary System Components

- **Streamer/DAC**: Wiim Ultra (10-band parametric EQ)
- **Speakers**: Larsen 4.3 (main stereo pair)
- **Subwoofers**: SVS 3000 Micro (dual setup with 3-band PEQ each)

## 📊 What You’ll Find Here

### Documentation

- **Measurement Data**: Room response measurements, before/after comparisons
- **EQ Settings**: Detailed parametric EQ configurations for each component
- **Tuning Process**: Step-by-step methodology for achieving target response
- **Room Acoustics**: Environmental factors and treatment considerations

### Community Resources

- Best practices for PEQ implementation
- Measurement techniques and tools
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Integration guides for similar setups
